# Ice-Cream-Dispenser-Java
A java program that was designed and coded in a team of four people from my very first java class cps 1231. This program was made in reference to a vending machine but you can customize your product and it calculates the price accordingly. Users can select multiple kinds of ice cream within the same transaction. It also has additional features like discounts and coupons which the user can input and it should be valid. Then it calculates the subtotal and add tax and outputs a grand total, proceeds to the payment method, and after the transaction has been done finally dispenses the product to the end-user just like a soda or snacks vending machine.
